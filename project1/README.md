# Book Review Website

Hey, this is Fahim Ak submitted my second project (project1), it is a book review web application 
where a user can register,login and check out books from 5000 books imported to the database (which is done in import.py)
also review those books. books.py is the main python file that ive used here,I also used few other html,css templates 
so that it is displayed nicely. hope you like it, Thank You :)
Done using python, Flask, postgreSQL, javascript
